\section{Disclaimer}

A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. The findings and recommendations reflects the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period. 

Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. \textbf{\companyName} prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. \textbf{\companyName} recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.
