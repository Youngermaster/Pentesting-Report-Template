# Basics

This is not just a *proof of concept*, but a basic utilization of [Pandoc][2]'s behavior
when it comes to [Markdown][1] processing.

* Pandoc, by default, passes any \LaTeX\ code snippets it identifies within the Markdown
  source file to the target document, if that target document is a \LaTeX\ one (this
  includes f.e. Beamer or PDF output.
  (It does not pass these snippets to any other output formats, but instead drops them.)

* Pandoc, by default, also passes any HTML code snippets it identifies within the
  Markdown sources to the target document, should that be HTML based (this includes f.e.
  EPUB or RevealJS output).
  (It does not pass these snippets to any other output formats, but instead drops them.)

* This allows for any specific formatting to be achieved in the target document format:
  ***(1)*** Insert two versions of the snippet, one as HTML, one as \LaTeX\. ***(2)***
  The HTML one will make it to the HTML-based targets, while \LaTeX\ is being dropped;
  the \LaTeX\ will make it into \LaTeX-based targets, while the HTML is being dropped.
