\section{Disclaimer}

A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. The findings and
recommendations reflects the information gathered during the assessment and not
any changes or modifications made outside of that period.

Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security
controls. \textbf{\companyName} prioritized the assessment to identify the
weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. \textbf{\companyName}
recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or
third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

\subsection{Assesment overview}
From \textit{Date 1} to \textit{Date 2}, \textbf{\companyName} engaged
Penetration tests to evaluate the security posture of its infrastructure
compared to current industry best practices. All testing performed is based on
the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and
Assessment, OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks.

Phases conducted for penetration testing are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Planning and preparation.
    \item Reconnaissance / Discovery.
    \item Vulnerability Enumeration / Analysis.
    \item Initial Exploitation.
    \item Expanding Foothold / Deeper Penetration.
    \item Cleanup.
    \item Report Generation.
\end{itemize}
