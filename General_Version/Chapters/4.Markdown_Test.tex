This is not just a \emph{proof of concept}, but a basic utilization of
{[}Pandoc{]}{[}2{]}'s behavior when it comes to {[}Markdown{]}{[}1{]}
processing.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
          Pandoc, by default, passes any \LaTeX~code snippets it identifies
          within the Markdown source file to the target document, if that target
          document is a \LaTeX~one (this includes f.e. Beamer or PDF output. (It
          does not pass these snippets to any other output formats, but instead
          drops them.)
    \item
          Pandoc, by default, also passes any HTML code snippets it identifies
          within the Markdown sources to the target document, should that be
          HTML based (this includes f.e. EPUB or RevealJS output). (It does not
          pass these snippets to any other output formats, but instead drops
          them.)
    \item
          This allows for any specific formatting to be achieved in the target
          document format: \textbf{\emph{(1)}} Insert two versions of the
          snippet, one as HTML, one as \LaTeX. \textbf{\emph{(2)}} The HTML one
          will make it to the HTML-based targets, while \LaTeX~is being dropped;
          the \LaTeX~will make it into \LaTeX-based targets, while the HTML is
          being dropped.
\end{itemize}
