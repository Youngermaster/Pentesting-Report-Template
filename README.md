# Pentesting-Report-Template

This is a template made on LaTex to report the processes made to pentest a software or infrastructure (or even hardware).

## How to run?

### Linux

To build the CV, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system and `pdflatex` or `latexmk`. You can then build the CV by running the following command:

```shell
latexmk -pdf template.tex
# or
pdflatex main.tex
```

## Docker support

1. **Build Your Docker Image**

First, you need to build the Docker image from your `Dockerfile`. Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and run:

```bash
docker build -t latex_env .
```

This command builds a Docker image with the tag `latex_env` from the Dockerfile in the current directory. The dot `.` at the end specifies the build context as the current directory.

2. **Run Your Docker Container**

After building the image, you can run a container from it. You'll want to mount the directory containing your LaTeX project (for example, `cv.tex` and related files) to a directory inside the container so that you can access and compile your LaTeX project from within the container.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/latex/project:/project latex_env
```

Replace `/path/to/your/latex/project` with the absolute path to the directory on your host machine that contains your LaTeX project. This command mounts it to `/project` inside the container. The `-it` option allows you to interact with the container, and `--rm` automatically removes the container when you exit.

3. **Compile Your LaTeX Project**

Once inside the container, navigate to the mounted directory:

```bash
cd /project
```

Then, you can compile your LaTeX project using `pdflatex`:

```bash
latexmk -pdf template.tex
# or
pdflatex main.tex
```

This command will generate the output files (e.g., `cv.pdf`) in your project directory, which is mounted from your host, so you can access them even after the container is removed.

4. **Exit the Container**

When you're done, you can exit the container by typing `exit`. The container will stop, and due to the `--rm` flag, it will also be automatically removed.
